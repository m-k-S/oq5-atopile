# TI TPSM863257 Synchronous Buck Module

TI TPSM863257 is a high-efficiency synchronous buck converter module with integrated inductor and MOSFETs. It provides 3V to 17V input voltage range with 0.6V to 5.5V adjustable output voltage and up to 3A continuous current. Features FCCM (Forced Continuous Conduction Mode) for low output ripple and 1.2MHz switching frequency.

    Minimal usage example for ti-tpsm863257.

    """

    # Create the buck converter instance
    buck_converter = new TPSM863257

    # Input power supply (12V)
    power_12v = new ElectricPower
    power_12v.voltage = 12V +/- 3%

    # Output power rail (3.3V)

    # Power good indicator (optional)
    power_good_signal = new ElectricLogic
    power_good_signal.reference ~ power_3v3

    # Connect power rails
    power_12v ~> buck_converter ~> power_3v3

    # Connect control signals (enable has internal pullup, so it's optional)
    power_good_signal ~ buck_converter.power_good
